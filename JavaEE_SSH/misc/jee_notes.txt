I have also experienced this problem with Eclipse Kepler running on Fedora 18. I executed these steps to create new Server in Eclipse:

1. Click Server tab
2. Click link to create new server
3. Highlight Tomcat v7.0 Server

Server host name is set to localhost
Server name is blank

Next> button is not active. Only Cancel button is available.

If I selected Tomcat v6.0 Server, the server host name is localhost and server name is populated. Next> button is active.

I have attempted to remove the runtime and add it again with no success. I found a Juno fix by removing some config files, but it did not work either. Is there another fix for Kepler?

I've just posted and found the solution in stackoverflow (stackoverflow.com/questions/14791843/eclipse-add-tomcat-7-blank-server-name):

Quote:

    1. Close Eclipse
    2. In {workspace-directory}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings delete the following two files:
    org.eclipse.wst.server.core.prefs
    org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core.prefs
    3. Restart Eclipse

eclipse complains /usr/share/tomecat7/conf not found.
create a soft link and then it works:
ln -s /usr/share/tomecat7/conf /var/lib/tomcat7/conf

Could not load the Tomcat server configuration at /Servers/Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost-config. The configuration may be corrupt or incomplete
On May 12, 2012, in Eclipse, by lucasterdev

You installed Tomcat v7 within eclipse using the “Add server” wizard and the  “download and install” button.

You tried to start Tomcat and got the following error:

    “Could not load the Tomcat server configuration at /Servers/Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost-config. The configuration may be corrupt or incomplete”

How to solve:

    Close Eclipse
    Copy all files from TOMCAT_7_HOME/conf to WORKSPACE_FOLDER/Servers/Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost-config
    Start Eclipse
    Expand the Servers project, click on the Tomcat 7 project and hit F5
    Start Tomcat from Eclipse

I found the solution on stackoverflow.

It seems to be a bug in eclipse and here is the workaround to solve the bug:

Note: I am using Ubuntu Linux.

    - Close Eclipse
    - Go to your Eclipse workspace directory
    - Then go to directory .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings
    - In Ubuntu, I do it by: cd ~/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings
    - Delete the following two files:
    - org.eclipse.wst.server.core.prefs
    – org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core.prefs
    - You can do it by the following command:
    rm org.eclipse.wst.server.core.prefs
    rm org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core.prefs
    - Start Eclipse 

If the above solution did not solve the problem then you can try the following solution which contains creating some softlinks along with deleting the above mentioned files.

    - Run the following commands in terminal

    cd ~/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/
    rm org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core.prefs
    rm org.eclipse.wst.server.core.prefs
    cd /usr/share/tomcat7
    sudo service tomcat7 stop
    sudo update-rc.d tomcat7 disable
    sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/conf conf
    sudo ln -s /etc/tomcat7/policy.d/03catalina.policy conf/catalina.policy
    sudo ln -s /var/log/tomcat7 log
    sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/tomcat7/conf
    sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/common common
    sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/server server
    sudo ln -s /var/lib/tomcat7/shared shared

    - Restart eclipse
    - In Project Explorer of Eclipse, you can see ‘Servers’. Right click and delete it.
    - Re-add the Server (File -> New -> Other -> Server)
    - Now your project on Eclipse should run fine.

=========================================================
Eclipse:

server path: workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.server.core/tmp0/wtpwebapps

-- while general tomcat7 server is at:
/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT

So the better way to make both running, is to let:
the default general one running on 8080 and 8005,
and let eclipse one running on 8081 and 8006.
and both use different web root.

==> well, after testing in eclipse is done, then, similar to export Android project,
you export the Events as Events.war to the general root at /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps,
there Events.war will be automatically unpacked to Events/ folder, and you can visit
localhost:8080/Events/.

If you rename Events.war to Events2.war, then soon Events2/ will appear, and Events/ is gone.

So it seems that eclipse does it by:
- start a second tomcat server, on different port (e.g., 8081 here)
- after dev/test is done, export/deploy to production server.
- if eclipse is closed, then the dev/test site (8081) is down.

not bad. this way dev and production are separate.

-------------
extract a WAR file:
jar -xvf *.war

=========
apache2 runs multiple processes. It's normal.
apache uses 1 process handles 1 user request. Create a new process is slow, so multiple are started and waiting.

Only 1 is owned by root, others spawn from this and are owned by www-data.

=========
Xorg process is the X GUI process. If kill it, will be forced logout.
